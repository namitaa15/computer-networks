# üåê Network Basics ‚Äì Computer Networking Interview Notes

## 1. What is a Network?

- A **network** is a group of devices (like computers, printers, phones, etc.) connected together to share information and resources.
- Devices in a network can "talk" to each other through some kind of connection‚Äîthis can be **wired** (like cables) or **wireless** (like Wi-Fi).
- The main idea is **sharing**: share data, resources (like printers), and allow communication.

**Real-life Analogy:**  
Think of a network as a group of friends who pass notes and share things in a classroom. The connection between them (maybe sitting next to each other or using paper planes) is like a network link.

## 2. What is a Computer Network?

- A **computer network** is a set of two or more computers (and related devices) connected to each other to exchange data and share resources.
- It allows communication between devices and lets them use resources together.
- Devices in the network are called **nodes** (e.g., computers, phones, printers).
- The connection between nodes is called a **link** (wired or wireless).

**Key Features:**
- **Sharing:** Exchange files, documents, and data.
- **Resource Use:** Use one printer, scanner, or internet for multiple computers.
- **Communication:** Send emails, instant messages, or video calls within the network.
- **Remote Access:** Access files or devices from far away.

## 3. Why Do We Use Networks? (Advantages & Uses)

- **Data Sharing:**  
  Share files, images, videos, and documents quickly between devices.
- **Resource Sharing:**  
  Use the same printer, internet connection, or storage device across multiple computers.
- **Communication:**  
  Send emails, messages, or make video/audio calls between users on the network.
- **Remote Access:**  
  Work on your office computer from home, or fix someone‚Äôs computer remotely.
- **Backup & Security:**  
  Keep data safe by storing it on a central server, or create backups easily.
- **Collaboration:**  
  Teams can work together on shared documents, software, or databases.

**Summary Table:**

| Advantage          | Description                                         | Example                                    |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Data Sharing       | Send/receive files quickly                          | Send a photo from laptop to mobile         |
| Resource Sharing   | Use same hardware for many users                    | One printer for all office PCs             |
| Communication      | Talk/message easily                                 | Office chat or email system                |
| Remote Access      | Use devices/files from anywhere                     | Work from home on office files             |
| Security/Backup    | Centralized storage and backup                      | Company server stores all employee data    |
| Collaboration      | Work together on projects easily                    | Google Docs, shared code repositories      |

## 4. Real-Life Examples of a Network

### 1. **Home Wi-Fi Network**
- Your smartphone, laptop, and smart TV all connect to the Wi-Fi router.
- You can send a video from your phone to your TV, or print from your laptop without plugging in.

### 2. **Office LAN (Local Area Network)**
- All office computers are connected so employees can use the same printer, access shared files, and browse the internet.
- Emails, chats, and project files are exchanged within seconds.

### 3. **School/College Network**
- Computer labs connect all PCs to a central server, so students can log in from any computer and access their data.

### 4. **The Internet (Biggest Network!)**
- Connects millions of networks around the world.
- Allows web browsing, YouTube, online gaming, Google Meet, etc.

**Analogy:**  
A computer network is like a city‚Äôs road system. Just as roads connect houses and shops to let people and goods move easily, a network connects devices to let information and resources move smoothly.
