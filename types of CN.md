# üåê Types of Computer Networks 

---

## 1. What are the Different Types of Computer Networks?

Computer networks are classified based on their size, coverage area, and usage. The main types are:

- **PAN (Personal Area Network)**
- **LAN (Local Area Network)**
- **HAN (Home Area Network)**
- **CAN (Campus Area Network)**
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**
- **GAN (Global Area Network)**
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**

---

## 2. Explain PAN (Personal Area Network) with an Example

- **PAN** is the smallest type of network, meant for a single person and their devices.
- It typically covers a range of up to 10 meters.
- Used to connect personal devices like smartphones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches, wireless headphones, etc.

**Example:**  
When you connect your phone to your laptop using Bluetooth, or your wireless mouse to your computer, you‚Äôre using a PAN.

## 3. What is a LAN (Local Area Network)? Where is it Used?

- **LAN** connects devices in a small geographical area, like a single building or a floor.
- Common in homes, schools, offices, labs, or small organizations.
- All devices in a LAN can share files, printers, and internet access.

**Examples of LAN Usage:**
- An office where all employees‚Äô computers are connected to the same printer and internet.
- Computer labs in schools/colleges.

---

## 4. What is HAN (Home Area Network) and How is it Different from LAN?

- **HAN** is a type of LAN, but specifically used within a home.
- Connects all home devices: computers, smart TVs, phones, printers, security cameras, etc.
- Allows family members to share internet, printers, or stream content between devices.

**Difference from LAN:**
- **HAN** is only for home usage and usually smaller in size.
- **LAN** can be for any small area (office, school, etc.), not just homes.

---

## 5. What is CAN (Campus Area Network)? Give an Example

- **CAN** connects multiple LANs within a campus area, like a university, school, or business park.
- Used to link different departments, buildings, or hostels inside a campus.

**Example:**  
A university network connecting the admin block, library, student hostels, and labs, so everyone can access shared resources.

---

## 6. What is MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)? Where do We See It in Real Life?

- **MAN** covers a large city or town (bigger than LAN/CAN, smaller than WAN).
- Connects different LANs in a city‚Äîlike branches of a bank, or city-wide cable TV networks.

**Real-life Examples:**
- City government offices‚Äô network.
- Broadband/cable TV providers connecting the whole city.

---

## 7. Explain WAN (Wide Area Network) with an Example

- **WAN** covers a very large area‚Äîcan connect cities, countries, or even continents.
- Made by connecting multiple LANs and MANs together.
- Uses public networks (like telephone lines, satellite links, fiber optics).

**Example:**  
A multinational company‚Äôs offices in India, USA, and UK are all connected via WAN to share data.

- **The Internet itself is the largest example of a WAN.**

---

## 8. What is GAN (Global Area Network)? Is the Internet a GAN?

- **GAN** covers the entire globe.
- Connects multiple WANs together, often using satellites.
- Designed to provide global connectivity (anywhere in the world).

**Is the Internet a GAN?**  
Yes, the Internet is the biggest GAN, because it connects networks worldwide using satellites, undersea cables, and other global infrastructure.

---

## 9. What is a VPN (Virtual Private Network)? Why is it Used?

- **VPN** stands for Virtual Private Network.
- It creates a **secure, encrypted connection (a tunnel)** over a public network (like the Internet).
- Used to safely connect remote users to their organization‚Äôs network, protect data privacy, and bypass geo-restrictions.

**Uses of VPN:**
- Employees access their office network from home securely.
- Bypassing blocked websites or protecting online activity on public Wi-Fi.

## 10. List Any Two Differences Between LAN and WAN

| Feature         | LAN                                      | WAN                                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Coverage Area   | Small area (room, building)              | Large area (city, country, worldwide)    |
| Ownership       | Usually owned by one organization        | Can be public or owned by many parties   |
| Speed           | High speed                               | Lower speed compared to LAN              |
| Cost            | Cheaper to set up and maintain           | Expensive due to large-scale coverage    |

## 11. Which Network Type Would You Use for a College Campus? Why?

- **CAN (Campus Area Network)** is the best choice for a college campus.
- It connects all the buildings (departments, hostels, library) within the campus.
- Provides high-speed internal communication and resource sharing among students and staff.

---

## 12. How is a VPN Different from a Normal Network?

- **Normal Network:** Data may travel openly and can be accessed by others on the network if not secured.
- **VPN:** Encrypts all data sent/received, so even if someone intercepts the data, they cannot read it.
- VPN provides privacy, security, and can mask your location, which a normal network does not offer.
